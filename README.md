# Calling Microsoft Graph from a Python web app

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of the Microsoft identity platform (formerly Azure AD v2.0) Check it out: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-webapp

If you really need to access this Azure AD v1.0, you can navigate to the [master](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-python-webapp-graphapi/tree/master) branch, but please know that it's no longer supported.
